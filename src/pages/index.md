        Our exercise classes and other activities are still on hold following government guidelines. Our funding is secure, and we will reinstate them once we are confident that the appropriate measures have been implemented to ensure your health and wellbeing.
        
        Once again, despite some charities closing due to financial pressures, the group is not in that position and The Trustees look forward to seeing you all again in the future.

        We will contact our members in due course â€“ should you wish to contact us please contact Barry on 0191 5656892 or Jim on 0191 5226750.

        Thank you and stay safe.
