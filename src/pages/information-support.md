        We run affordable day trips throughout the year to a range of places, favourites include The Lake District, Whitby and The Yorkshire Dales. We also make sure to include an annual festive trip, our last being to Edinburgh and we enjoyed the Christmas market! On our trips we can either travel around the location as a group or go your own way.

        Why not come and take part on one of our monthly walks around the region? It is a great way to socialise and exercise in a different way to the classes. Some popular walks include riverside, history, and woodland walks and our favourite Tynemouth fish and chip walk. Feel free to bring friends, family and four-legged friends along with you!
